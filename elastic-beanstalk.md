Elastic Beanstalk
=================

This service is used to deploy and scale services and web applications developed on Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go and Docker. Think on Beanstalk as the Heroku of AWS.

Highlights:
-----------

-	Beanstalk handles the deployment, capacity, load balancing, auto scaling and health check
-	This is a free service, you pay only for the services it provision.
-	The application will deploy a managed EC2 instance to run the application.
-	You don't have access to the EC2 instance.
-	You can run your own docker images.
-	It is recommended for fast deployments and for small startups (is not recommended for production on enterprises).
-	You can apply the same rules that you can apply on standard EC2 instances.
